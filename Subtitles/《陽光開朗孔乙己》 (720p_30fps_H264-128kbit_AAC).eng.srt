1
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,499
Wearing a long-tattered gown,

2
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,432
I went straight to the pub in Lu Town.

3
00:00:14,433 --> 00:00:16,599
I called the waiter and ordered two bowls of wine

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,799
and a plate of fennel beans for 9 coins.

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,199
I spoke in a Classical Chinese style (obscure or complicated language to sound intelligent), which drew ridicule.

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,165
Unconsciously, my face turned red.

7
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:25,332
How can you tarnish my innocence like this?

8
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:27,632
I took a sip of wine and continued to argue with them.

9
00:00:27,633 --> 00:00:28,865
The reason why Xiangzi (from <i>Rickshaw Boy</i>) died

10
00:00:28,866 --> 00:00:31,699
was because he did not work hard enough to pull his rickshaw.

11
00:00:31,766 --> 00:00:33,132
In every article by Lu Xun,

12
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:35,965
he touches upon the untouchable topics.

13
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,765
Chen Sheng and Wu Guang did not have sweet lives (first uprising against the Qin dynasty)

14
00:00:37,766 --> 00:00:40,432
because they did not have their feet on the ground (being realistic).

15
00:00:40,433 --> 00:00:41,832
At the last moment, everyone in the pub turned their eyes toward me,

16
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:43,165
asking what kind of thing did I become.

17
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:44,499
I looked at my long gown and said that I was

18
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:48,632
A sunny and cheerful Kong Yiji.
A sunny and cheerful Kong Yiji.

19
00:00:48,633 --> 00:00:53,132
In his bizarre writing style, he questioned if I was convinced or not.

20
00:00:53,133 --> 00:00:57,332
A sunny and cheerful Kong Yiji.
A sunny and cheerful Kong Yiji.

21
00:00:57,333 --> 00:01:01,832
Even if my labor falls into the river, I won't sell myself cheaply to you.

22
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:06,099
A sunny and cheerful Kong Yiji.
A sunny and cheerful Kong Yiji.

23
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:10,665
You drive a Lamborghini but laugh at me for not working hard enough.

24
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:14,799
A sunny and cheerful Kong Yiji.
A sunny and cheerful Kong Yiji.

25
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:19,165
What does this decaying old society have to do with me?

26
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:21,332
Although I wash my face every day,

27
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:23,599
my empty pockets are cleaner than my face.

28
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,265
I have to wear a changshan (traditional Manchu robe),

29
00:01:25,266 --> 00:01:27,832
and work hard copying books for the officials.

30
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:30,032
I thought the job would be easy,

31
00:01:30,033 --> 00:01:32,265
but it turned out to be 996 (from 9:00 AM to 9:00 PM, 6 days per week).

32
00:01:32,266 --> 00:01:34,432
After finishing my work, I maliciously demanded my wages,

33
00:01:34,433 --> 00:01:37,032
and the hungry me was arrested by the officials.

34
00:01:37,166 --> 00:01:38,799
Why does this extremely evil old society

35
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,532
have no labor laws?

36
00:01:41,533 --> 00:01:43,332
Why is the dignity of us common people

37
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:45,865
so easily trampled by the meat eaters?

38
00:01:45,866 --> 00:01:48,032
These outrageous stories and experiences of suffering,

39
00:01:48,033 --> 00:01:50,299
no one dares to answer them now.

40
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,665
Finally, the diners turned their eyes toward me,

41
00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:53,032
asking why was I not afraid at all.

42
00:01:53,033 --> 00:01:54,432
I smiled and said because I am

43
00:01:54,433 --> 00:01:58,532
A sunny and cheerful Kong Yiji.
A sunny and cheerful Kong Yiji.

44
00:01:58,533 --> 00:02:03,032
The small and weak branches have already given up struggling long ago.

45
00:02:03,033 --> 00:02:07,265
A sunny and cheerful Kong Yiji.
A sunny and cheerful Kong Yiji.

46
00:02:07,266 --> 00:02:11,765
The edges and corners wore away over time, leaving only a few scars.

47
00:02:11,766 --> 00:02:15,999
A sunny and cheerful Kong Yiji.
A sunny and cheerful Kong Yiji.

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,599
Optimism is my claws and teeth, while tears flow behind my mask.

49
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,832
A sunny and cheerful Kong Yiji.
A sunny and cheerful Kong Yiji.

50
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:29,032
When you ask me if I am happy, I just want to curse.

51
00:02:29,033 --> 00:02:31,099
After I finished speaking,

52
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,632
the air in the pub was filled with joy.

53
00:02:33,633 --> 00:02:36,032
What do those insults, doubts, refutations, and ridicule

54
00:02:36,033 --> 00:02:37,699
have to do with me?

55
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,865
Studying is for the rise of China,

56
00:02:39,866 --> 00:02:42,532
not for delivering takeout or packages.

57
00:02:42,533 --> 00:02:45,099
After everyone listened, they all showed a candid smile,

58
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,632
except for that idiot

59
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:50,799
A sunny and cheerful Kong Yiji.
A sunny and cheerful Kong Yiji.

60
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,299
Tear down this decaying wall, and seek the light of righteousness.

61
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:59,465
A sunny and cheerful Kong Yiji.
A sunny and cheerful Kong Yiji.

62
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,999
Regardless of criticism or praise, there needs to be someone applauding.

63
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,199
A sunny and cheerful Kong Yiji.
A sunny and cheerful Kong Yiji.

64
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,665
From all the top comments, how much hot blood is hard to cool down?

65
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:16,932
A sunny and cheerful Kong Yiji.
A sunny and cheerful Kong Yiji.

66
00:03:16,933 --> 00:03:21,832
Kong Ming (Zhuge Liang, most accomplished strategist during the Three Kingdoms period) is my ideal, yet Shang Yang (minister of Qin, executed for treason by dismemberment) is my fate.
